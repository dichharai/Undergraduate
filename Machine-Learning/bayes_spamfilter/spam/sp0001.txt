Dear Student,

I would like to offer you an opportunity for earning extra money and making your life easier.
Did you know it is possible to get paid just for giving your opinion?

Companies spend billions of dollars a year trying to convince consumers to buy their products and services.
Understanding consumer behavior helps companies improve their products and services and make more money.


Your participation in giving your opinions on different research surveys directly influences the way companies develop products,
services and policies and meet the needs of consumers better.


Incredible as it may seem, most people are totally unaware that big corporations will gladly pay you to fill out simple surveys on the internet.
They do a lot of testing before they launch a product on the market.

They really have to because if it bombs, it costs them millions of dollars.

Companies will pay you $5 to $95 per hour just to fill out simple online surveys from the comfort of your own home.
Get paid from $25 to over $260 per hour for participating in focus group panels for 30 to 60 minutes.
Have new products sent to you before they are released on the market.

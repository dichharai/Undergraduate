The University of Iowa is hosting a math modeling competition on Saturday, November 7.  Would you be interested in participating?  We would leave early in the morning, and get back late in the evening.  The last two years, a Luther team has won "Best Presentation," and each member of the winning team received $50 gift cards to Amazon.com.  The modeling challenges are usually related to current events, and you have a choice of two problems to choose from.  Background in courses like ODEs, computer science, and/or probability and statistices might be helpful.  Teams can have up to three people, so if you can find a team that has a relatively broad background, that is ideal.

However, even if you don't have a broad mathematical background, the competition is still fun and friendly (and free!), and you get free food for the day.  If you think you might be interested in this, please contact me at feyky01@luther.edu as soon as possible.  The registration deadline is October 30.

Cheers!

Kyle

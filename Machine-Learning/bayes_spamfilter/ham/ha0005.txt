Hi Everyone,

I hope you had a great fall break and an exciting homecoming weekend! The E-Club's Annual Richard Leake Elevator Pitch Competition will be held tomorrow. If you are interested in pitching a business idea in 90 seconds and representing Luther at the CEO conference this year, please attend this meeting. (This is open to everyone; even if you did not register in advance) 

Venue: Olin 201 ( Note; this is not our usual meeting room)

Time: 7:30 - 8:30

Looking forward to seeing you all!

Kind regards,
E-club

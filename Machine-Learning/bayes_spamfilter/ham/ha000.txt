Hello Class,
I hate to do this to you on the 1st day, but I have a ill child at home and
will need to stay home with her. We will not be having class tomorrow morning;
However, you do have homework.
Find out how to do:
Pilates 100
Stretch out your hamstrings (lie flat on your back and raise one leg up towards
the ceiling while keeping the opposite leg flat on the floor. Use your arms to
pull your leg closer to you chest). Take notice if one leg is tighter than the
other
Write down 3 things/goals that you want to achieve from this class.

See you all on Wednesday!

-Coach Danielle Lynch

Thank you, everyone,  for stopping into the Career Center and for taking time to guess the number of candy pieces in the pumpkin !

We had fun watching all the variations of how the guess-timates were done.

The correct number in the pumpkin was:  340
Ryan Pierce was the winner, with a guess of 335.

 We will continue with the fun and be sure to stop by the Career Center late November and into December when we will do our next guessing game.

Stop by the Career Center ANYTIME!   We love to help and hear what is going on in your lives!

Hope you all have a great Halloween Weekend!

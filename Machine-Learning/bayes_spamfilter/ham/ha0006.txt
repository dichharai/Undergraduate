This is just a reminder that today from 5:30 to 7:30 there will be community members and their children walking through our halls trick or treating. 

There will be signs indicating that rooms with pumpkins on them are handing out candy. If you did not sign up to hand out candy but would like to get involved there will be cookie decorating in the second floor lounge. 

Lets make sure that the community members leave our hall with not only candy but a great experience as well.
